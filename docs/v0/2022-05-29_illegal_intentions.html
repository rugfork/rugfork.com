Subject: Notice and demand in response to your expressed illegal intentions.</p>

<p>Please be advised that if I receive any report indicating that you may have executed your expressed illegal intentions, then I will publish a full evidentiary record of our correspondence at this webpage (including relevant email <tt>Received</tt> headers):</p>

<p><a href="https://rugfork.com/v0/2022-05-29_illegal_intentions.html">https://rugfork.com/v0/2022-05-29_illegal_intentions.html</a></p>

<p>The substantive text of this email (with your information redacted) is already published there.</p>

<p>I will leave it at that for now.  If <em>anything</em> that you told me is true, then you are a homeless individual with admitted mental issues who suffered a catastrophic financial loss from UST.  I much sympathize; of course, you are angry and upset about that!  When a thief steals your money, anger is a natural and normal response.  But then, you flipped out and flew into a rage at me because I offered knowledge to correct some of your basic technical misconceptions about Bitcoin.</p>

<p>That bears on the credibility of your expressed intentions.  You don’t even know how email works:  You believe that email is “feeless”.  You apparently don’t know what spam is, or that Hashcash was a proposed quasi-fee for email.  Therefore, I think that you are probably just trying to show me up by bragging about a wild wannabe-hacker fantasy that you have neither the technical skills nor the operational ability to execute.  Out of empathy for your plight, I have no desire to get you in trouble for that.</p>

<p>I do think it’s reprehensible that you wish, in effect, to destroy evidence that I am working to try to preserve.  That would be a gift to Terra.  Even worse in the abstract, you wish to respond to Do Kwon’s crimes with some crimes of your own.  I am not a criminal like Do Kwon.  My cause is just.  I will take the high road.</p>

<p>I advise you to seek legal assistance recovering the money that Terra owes to you—and to get some sort of help staying grounded in reality.  Also, please work on your ability to manage anger, and to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate responses to things that make you angry.</p>

<p>Now, I demand that you immediately cease and desist from contacting me.  I have no interest in discussions of illegal activity, or in discussions with people who want to discuss illegal activity.  Any further correspondence from you may be published here at my sole discretion, with your identifying information unredacted.</p>

<p>Hyperion</p>
