<p>Further news updates/site updates are in the works.  I am one individual with limited resources, and I have plenty of work to do here; please understand that lack of update does not mean lack of activity. (2022-05-29)</p>
<!--<strong>News:</strong>  My Terra forum account has been suspended since 2022-05-27 20:18:28.  I am unable to reply to posts or PMs there.  Please see below for my contact information; I am not on TG or Discord.  Thanks to those who have emailed me supportive messages or inquiries.</p>

I request that someone should please post a note to <a href="https://agora.terra.money/t/rugfork-com-needs-community-assistance-preserving-evidence/40537">the Rugfork.com announcement thread</a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/JJGLo">archive</a>), explaining in a polite and professional manner that I will be unable to engage in the discussion right now.</p>

<p>This occurred soon after I opened <a href="https://archive.ph/Wi9PU">an inquiry</a> that was <a href="https://archive.ph/yqEUu">promptly deleted</a>.  I later removed this alert message from my websites for a few hours, because the system sent me some messages that seemed ambiguously to imply that my account may be active again.  I needed some time to try making a substantive post.  Nope!  Still can’t post.</p>-->

<h2>Documenting the Terra Fork</h2>

<p>The parties wielding centralized control of the Terra blockchain evidently believe that they can divert value with a contentious hardfork, <a href="img/terra_newspeak_forbids_doubleplusungood_words.png">sweep it all under the rug (so to speak)</a>, and merrily make off with whatever capital they can extract from the catastrophe that they themselves created.</p>

<p>They are wrong.</p>

<p>UST holders and LUNA holders alike deserve a permanent, <em>easily accessible</em> public record of these events.  Someone needs to spearhead an effort to gather, organize, fact-check, and present that record.  Instead of wishing for someone else to step up and do it, I’ll do it myself!  I invite the community to join me.</p>

<p>The site’s full content will be open-source; however, I must appoint myself <abbr title="Benevolent Dictator For Life">BDFL</abbr> and exercise some centralized authority, to assure adequate fact-checking and informational integrity.  I also want to avoid developing too much dependency on centralized services.  This is a long-term project.  For now, until I figure out how to handle infrastructure, please do <em>not</em> send me PRs or other direct contributions.</p>

<h3>Urgent Action Items</h3>

<p><strong>I request the community’s assistance with the following.</strong>  This is a non-exclusive list; I do not wish to telegraph what data I am gathering, or interested in.</p>

<ul>
<li>Terra <code>columbus-5</code> blockchain data from the time before the crash, to the time immediately after the fork.  <strong>If you have an independent node, then if nothing else, please make a textfile with some recent blockhashes, PGP-sign it, <a href="https://opentimestamps.org/">timestamp it</a>, and send it to me.</strong>  I will publish such attestations here.  That will be checkpoint evidence, in case of any future questions about the integrity of the blockchain.  Oh, and make sure that your node does not prune away data from the past few weeks!</li>
<li>The vote information sought at the companion site, <strong><a href="https://rugforkers.com/">Rugforkers.com</a>.</strong></li>
<li>(Lots of other stuff.  TBD when appropriate.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to help, please feel free to reach out to me by email.  Preferably <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">with crypto</a>.  I am not currently on TG; I may go there, but have no time for that now.  I am <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/12/28/Dont-use-Discord-for-FOSS.html"><em>not</em> on Discord, and don’t plan ever to use that horrid network</a>.  I tried to get <a href="https://twitter.com/doom_and_moon/status/1526615841130827776">on Twitter</a> (<a href="https://nitter.net/doom_and_moon/status/1526615841130827776">Nitter</a>), but they <a href="https://forum.torproject.net/t/tor-twitter-and-the-twitter-onion-beware/3367">shadowbanned me for being a Tor onion user</a>; I do not check DMs.  Of course, if you have Twitter, you are welcome to retweet my forthcoming attempt at announcing this site!</p>

<p>Everyone has email.  It works.  It’s easy.  Use it.</p>

<p>(Disclosure:  I hold millions of darling little LUNAs.  LUNA—the genuine, original LUNA, not “LUNC”.  I do not currently hold any UST—although I have in the past kept so much of my money in UST that I would have been wiped out, if a financial emergency had not forced me to spend my UST before the full de-peg.  I held UST on principle, out of desire for a fully decentralized stablecoin.  I never got the Anchor 20%.)</p>
